Based on the sample L3 VPN configuration schema provided and the user query along with the variable values, we will create a configuration for VRF named 'Client_A' on the PE routers. Below is the generated configuration:

```plaintext
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.10.10.4:65000
    route-target export 65000:100
    route-target import 65000:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65000 
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 remote-as 65002
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end

vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.10.10.6:65000
    route-target export 65000:100
    route-target import 65000:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/3
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65000 
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.6.2 remote-as 65004
        neighbour 10.0.6.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end
```

### Explanation:
1. **VRF Definition**: For each PE router (PE-1 and PE-2), a VRF named 'Client_A' was defined with a route-distinguisher (RD) and route-targets. Here, an arbitrary route-target (`65000:100`) is used; this can be adjusted per your specific routing policies.
  
2. **Interface Configuration**: The interfaces on the PE routers connected to the corresponding CE routers were specified to use the 'Client_A' VRF.

3. **BGP Configuration**: For each PE router (PE-1 and PE-2), a BGP configuration was added that includes the necessary IPv4 address-family configuration to establish internal BGP (iBGP) peering with their respective CE routers.

Make sure to adjust the values of the RD and route-targets as per your specific needs.
