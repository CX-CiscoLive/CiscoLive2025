Based on the user query and the provided variable values, here is the generated configuration file for deploying an L3 VPN with the specified VRF name 'Client_A':

```plaintext
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.10.10.4:65000
    route-target export 65000:100
    route-target import 65000:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65000
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 remote-as 65001
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end
```

### Explanation of the Configuration:
1. **VRF Definition**:
   - The VRF named `Client_A` is defined with a Route Distinguisher (RD) constructed from the router ID of PE-1 (`10.10.10.4`) and an arbitrary AS number (`65000`), along with route-target for import/export.

2. **Interface Configuration**:
   - The interface `GigabitEthernet0/1` is configured to use the `Client_A` VRF.

3. **BGP Configuration**:
   - BGP is configured for the AS number `65000`, which represents the PE router. The neighbour (`10.0.4.1`) for the associated CE router (AS `65001`) has been activated under the address family for the defined VRF. 

### Notes:
- Adjust the Route Distinguisher and Route Targets as per your network design if needed.
- Ensure `65000` and `65001` AS numbers are correctly configured as per your requirements.
- Add any additional configuration as necessary, such as route policies or additional features depending on your network needs.
