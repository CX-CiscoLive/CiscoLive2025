Based on the provided configuration schema and the user query, here is the generated configuration file for setting up an L3 VPN with the specified values:

```plaintext
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.0.4.1:65001
    route-target export 65001:100
    route-target import 65001:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65001 
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 remote-as 65002
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end
```

### Explanation of the Configuration:

1. **VRF Definition**:
   - **VRF Name**: `Client_A`
   - **Route Distinguisher (RD)**: Using the loopback of the CE router (`10.0.4.1`) and an example Autonomous System Number (AS Number) `65001` for the PE router.
   - **Route Targets**: Both export and import route targets are set to `65001:100`.

2. **Address Family**:
   - Specifying the IPv4 address family under the VRF.

3. **Interface Configuration**:
   - The PE router interface connected to the CE router is `GigabitEthernet0/1` and will forward packets using the defined VRF `Client_A`.

4. **BGP Configuration**:
   - BGP is configured with AS number `65001` for the PE router.
   - The neighbour defined is the CE router (`10.0.4.2`) with remote AS `65002`, which is activated for communication.

### Notes:
- You may need to adjust the Autonomous System Numbers (`65001`, `65002`) and Route Targets (`65001:100`) based on your specific network deployment requirements, as these are just illustrative values.
