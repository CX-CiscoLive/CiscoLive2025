Based on the provided configuration schema and the user query, here is the generated configuration file for the L3 VPN with the specified details:

```plaintext
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.10.10.4:65001
    route-target export 65001:100
    route-target import 65001:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65001
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 remote-as 65002
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end
```

### Explanation of the Configuration Values:
- **VRF Name**: `Client_A` as provided in the user query.
- **Route Distinguisher (RD)**: Constructed as `<loopback of pe>:<as_number of pe>`. Here, the loopback of the PE router is `10.10.10.4` and I assumed an AS number (AS 65001).
- **Route Target**: Used `65001:100` for both export and import (this can be adjusted based on your exact requirements).
- **Interface**: Based on the `connectedInterface`, `GigabitEthernet0/1` connects to `CE-A1` (10.0.4.2).
- **BGP AS Number**: Assuming PE router's AS number `65001`, and for the CE router itâ€™s `65002`.

Adjust the values like the AS numbers or Route Targets as necessary based on your network requirements.
