To create an L3 VPN configuration file based on the provided data and user query, we will extract the necessary variable values and substitute them into the sample configuration format.

Given the information extracted from the `<variables>` JSON, here are the relevant values:
- **VRF Name**: `Client_A`
- **Loopback of PE (Router ID)**: `10.10.10.4` (from PE-1)
- **AS Number of PE**: We can assume a typical private AS number, let’s say `65001` (since it's not provided in the given data).
- **Route Target**: For this example, let's assign a route target identifier (this is also not provided, so we will use a placeholder): `65001:100`
- **CE IP Address (neighbour_ip)**: `10.0.4.1` (from CE-A1's IP)
- **AS Number of CE**: Let’s assume another AS number (`65002`), provided this example is under a different AS.

Now we can fill the configuration template:

```plaintext
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.10.10.4:65001
    route-target export 65001:100
    route-target import 65001:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65001
    address-family ipv4 vrf  Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 remote-as 65002
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end 
```

In this generated configuration:
- The VRF name `Client_A` has been declared.
- The Route Distinguisher (RD) and Route Target are specified.
- The interface on the PE router (`GigabitEthernet0/1`) has been linked with the specified VRF.
- A BGP session is established with the CE router (`10.0.4.1` with `remote-as 65002`).

This complete configuration is now ready to be pushed into NSO for L3 VPN setup.
