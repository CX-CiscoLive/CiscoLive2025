Based on the provided user query and variable values, the configuration file for L3 VPN service with the specified VRF name 'Client_A' can be generated as follows:

```plaintext
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.0.4.1:65001
    route-target export 65001:100
    route-target import 65001:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A
!
router bgp 65001
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 remote-as 65002
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end
```

### Explanation:
1. **VRF Definition**:
   - **VRF Name**: 'Client_A'
   - **RD**: The route distinguisher is formulated using the loopback IP of the PE router (`10.0.4.1` from the `router_id` of `PE-1`) and a hypothetical AS number associated with it (`65001` is chosen as a representative example, but should be verified against actual configurations).
   - **Route Targets**: Examples `65001:100` for both export and import are added. These values can be modified based on your routing policy.

2. **Interface Configuration**:
   - **Interface**: The CE interface `GigabitEthernet0/1` from 'PE-1' is configured to forward to the VRF 'Client_A'.

3. **BGP Configuration**:
   - **AS Number**: `65001` is used for BGP out of option; in a practical scenario, this reflects the AS number of the PE router.
   - **Neighbor Details**: The neighbor is taken from the information of the CE router `10.0.4.2` with the remote AS number `65002` (hypothetical for the CE side).

Make sure to modify AS numbers and the route target values in accordance with the actual design requirements and existing configurations.
