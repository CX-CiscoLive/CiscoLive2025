Based on the provided user query and variable data, I will generate the necessary configuration files for the L3 VPN service with the VRF name 'Client_A'. Hereâ€™s the final configuration based on the sample configuration schema you've given.

### Configuration File for L3 VPN service

```plaintext
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.0.4.1:65001
    route-target export 65001:100
    route-target import 65001:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65001 
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 remote-as 65002
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end

vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.0.6.1:65003
    route-target export 65003:200
    route-target import 65003:200
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/3
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65003 
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.6.2 remote-as 65004
        neighbour 10.0.6.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end
```

### Explanation of the Configuration
1. **VRF Definitions**:
    - Two VRF definitions are created for the clients (here, `Client_A`).
    - Each VRF has its own Route Distinguisher (RD) and route targets for import and export. The RD combines the loopback IP of the PE router and the AS number appropriately.

2. **Interfaces**:
    - For both PE routers, the interfaces connecting to the CE routers are specified under the corresponding VRF.

3. **BGP Configuration**:
    - Each PE router is configured with BGP for the specific VRF, mentioning their respective neighbors (the IPs of the CE routers) and the appropriate remote AS numbers.

This configuration is structured to support the VPN service requirements for the specified client (Client_A) and should be compatible with an NSO environment. Please ensure that the AS numbers and route-targets used are accurate for your network's design before implementation.
