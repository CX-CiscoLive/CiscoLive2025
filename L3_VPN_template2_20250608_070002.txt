Based on the user query and the provided variable values, I will generate a configuration file for the L3 VPN service with the specified parameters. Here is the final configuration for the network setup:

```plaintext
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.0.4.1:65000
    route-target export target:65000:100
    route-target import target:65000:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A
!
router bgp 65000
    address-family ipv4 vrf  Client_A
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 remote-as 65001
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end
```

### Breakdown of the Configuration:
- **VRF Definition**: The VRF name is set to `Client_A`. The route distinguisher (RD) is derived from the CE router's loopback IP (`10.0.4.1`) and an assumed AS number for the PE (`65000`).
- **Route Targets**: I provided example route targets for export and import as `target:65000:100`.
- **Interface Configuration**: The interface on the PE connected to the CE is specified as `GigabitEthernet0/1` and it is assigned to the VRF `Client_A`.
- **BGP Configuration**: The BGP AS number is also assumed as `65000`, with the CE's remote AS number being `65001`. The neighbor IP is `10.0.4.2`, corresponding to the CE interface's IP.

### Note:
- The AS numbers and route targets used here are exemplary; adjustments may be necessary based on network requirements.
- Ensure that these values meet your organization's network design and policies before applying.
