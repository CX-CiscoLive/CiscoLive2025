Based on the provided user query and the variables extracted from the data, hereâ€™s the generated configuration file for the L3 VPN service with the VRF name as 'Client_A' on the PE router.

vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.10.10.4:65001
    route-target export 65001:100
    route-target import 65001:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A
!
router bgp 65001
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 remote-as 65002
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end

### Explanation of the Configuration:

- **VRF Definition**: The VRF named 'Client_A' is defined with a route-distinguisher (RD) consisting of the loopback IP of the PE router (`10.10.10.4`) and an autonomous system number (`65001`).
  
- **Route Targets**: The route targets for export and import are assumed to be `65001:100` for this example. This can be adjusted as necessary based on your specific routing policies.

- **Interface**: The configuration specifies the interface (`GigabitEthernet0/1`) where VRF forwarding will be applied, connecting to the CE router ('CE-A1').

- **BGP Configuration**: The BGP configuration for the PE router with AS number `65001` is set up to advertise routes for the VRF 'Client_A'. The neighbor `10.0.4.1` is the IP of the connected CE router, which is assigned AS number `65002`.

Adjust the AS numbers and route-targets as necessary to fit your network configuration and policies. If you have specific route-target values or additional interface details, feel free to modify them in the configuration.
