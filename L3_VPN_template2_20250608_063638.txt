Based on the provided sample configuration and the values extracted from the user query, here is the generated configuration file for the L3 VPN service with the specified VRF name 'Client_A':

```
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.0.4.1:65001
    route-target export 65001:100
    route-target import 65001:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A
!
router bgp 65001
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 remote-as 65002
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 activate
    exit-address-family
end
```

### Breakdown of the Configuration:
1. **VRF Definition**:
   - `VRF Name`: `Client_A`
   - `loopback of pe`: `10.0.4.1` (from `router_id` of PE-1)
   - `as_number of pe`: `65001` (assumed typical local AS)
   - `route_target`: Assuming standard route-targets `65001:100` for both export and import.

2. **Interface Configuration**:
   - `interface of pe`: `GigabitEthernet0/1` (connected to CE-A1)

3. **BGP Configuration**:
   - `as_number of pe`: `65001`
   - `neighbour_ip of ce interface`: `10.0.4.2` (from the IP address of the connected CE interface)
   - `as_number of ce`: `65002` (assumed typical remote AS for the CE)

Note: The Autonomous System numbers and route-targets are assumed based on standard practices, as they were not provided in the user query. Please make adjustments based on specific deployment requirements or existing network configurations.
