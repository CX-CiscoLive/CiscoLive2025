Based on the provided sample configuration and variable values from the user's query, the L3 VPN configuration file for the VRF named 'Client_A' can be generated as follows:

```plaintext
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.10.10.4:65000
    route-target export 65000:100
    route-target import 65000:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65000 
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 remote-as 65002
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end 
```

**Note:**
- For the `rd` (Route Distinguisher), I used the router ID of `PE-1` (10.10.10.4) with the AS number of `PE` (65000).
- The `route-target` export and import values can vary; I assumed a common format, such as `65000:100`, which you may modify based on your network requirements.
- The CE interfaces are set for their respective neighbouring routers using the provided IP addresses for their connections (`10.0.4.1` for `CE-A1` and `10.0.6.2` for `CE-A3`). Adjust these values further if needed according to your design criteria.
