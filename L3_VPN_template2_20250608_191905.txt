Based on the provided sample configuration schema, user query, and the variable values, here is a generated configuration for the L3 VPN with the specified VRF name 'Client_A' on the PE routers:

```plaintext
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.10.10.4:65000
    route-target export 65000:100
    route-target import 65000:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A
!
router bgp 65000
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 remote-as 65002
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end 
```

```plaintext
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.10.10.6:65000
    route-target export 65000:101
    route-target import 65000:101
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/3
    vrf forwarding Client_A
!
router bgp 65000
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A
        neighbour 10.0.6.2 remote-as 65004
        neighbour 10.0.6.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end 
```

### Explanation:
1. **VRF Definition**: For the VRF 'Client_A', a route-distinguisher (rd) is created for both PE routers based on their router IDs and AS numbers.
2. **Route Targets**: Placeholder values for export and import route targets are included (65000:100 and 65000:101), these can be modified based on actual requirements.
3. **Interface Configuration**: Each PE interface connected to the respective CE is configured under its VRF.
4. **BGP Configuration**: BGP configuration is defined under each PE router, including remote AS and activation of the neighbor relationship for both CE routers.

The configuration assumes a standard export-import route-target model; you can adjust as needed based on your specific network requirements.
