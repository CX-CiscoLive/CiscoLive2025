Based on the provided information and the configuration template for L3 VPN service, here is the final configuration file tailored for the scenario involving VRF name 'Client_A':

```plaintext
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.0.4.1:65000
    route-target export 65000:100
    route-target import 65000:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65000
    address-family ipv4 vrf  Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 remote-as 65001
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end
```

### Explanation of the Configuration:

1. **VRF Definition**:
    - **VRF Name**: Defined as `Client_A`.
    - **RD (Route Distinguisher)**: Constructed from the loopback IP `10.0.4.1` (router ID of PE-1) and the AS number of the PE router (`65000` assumed for this configuration).
    - **Route Target**: This configuration uses route target values `65000:100` for both import and export. This can be adjusted based on the actual requirements.

2. **Interface Configuration**:
    - The interface is `GigabitEthernet0/1`, which connects to the CE router `CE-A1`. This interface is assigned to the `Client_A` VRF.

3. **BGP Configuration**:
    - The AS number for the PE router is set to `65000`, and the neighbor's IP is `10.0.4.2` (the IP address of CE-A1).
    - The neighbor AS is `65001`, which is the assumed AS for the CE router.

Make adjustments to AS numbers, route targets, and other parameters as per actual network policies before deployment.
