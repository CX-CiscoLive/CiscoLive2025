Based on the provided data and user query, here is the generated L3 VPN configuration file for the specified parameters:

```plaintext
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.10.10.4:100
    route-target export 100:1
    route-target import 100:1
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A
!
router bgp 100
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 remote-as 200
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end
```

### Explanation of the Configuration:
- **VRF Definition:** 
  - Name: `Client_A`
  - Route Distinguisher (RD): `10.10.10.4:100` (using the `router_id` of the PE router `10.10.10.4` and an example AS number `100`).
  - Route Target: Here, I chose `100:1` for both export and import; it can be adjusted based on actual requirements.

- **Interface Configuration:** 
  - The PE's interface connected to the CE is defined as `GigabitEthernet0/1` and is associated with the VRF `Client_A`.

- **BGP Configuration:** 
  - The PE's AS number is assumed to be `100` (derived from the context, but can vary based on actual settings).
  - The CE's remote AS is exemplified as `200`.
  - The `neighbour` command points to the IP address of the CE interface `10.0.4.1`.

Adjust any parameters (like RD, Route Target, AS numbers, etc.) as necessary to fit your network's specific configurations.
