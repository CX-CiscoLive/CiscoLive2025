Based on the provided sample configuration and user query, the configuration file for the L3 VPN service with the specified VRF name 'Client_A' can be generated as follows. I'll use placeholders for necessary values that weren't specified, such as the loopback IP of the PE, the AS number of the PE, the route target, the interface of the PE, and the neighbor IP of the CE interface. 

Here's the generated configuration file:

```plaintext
vrf definition Client_A
    rd <loopback_of_pe>:<as_number_of_pe>
    route-target export <route_target>
    route-target import <route_target>
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface <interface_of_pe>
    vrf forwarding Client_A
!
router bgp <as_number_of_pe>
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A
        neighbour <neighbour_ip_of_ce_interface> remote-as <as_number_of_ce>
        neighbour <neighbour_ip_of_ce_interface> activate
    exit-address-family
end
```

### Notes:
- Replace `<loopback_of_pe>`, `<as_number_of_pe>`, `<route_target>`, `<interface_of_pe>`, `<neighbour_ip_of_ce_interface>`, and `<as_number_of_ce>` with the actual values you have in your network configuration.
- Make sure the configurations align with your network policies and existing setups before deploying the configuration into NSO.
