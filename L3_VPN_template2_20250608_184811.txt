Based on the provided user query and variable values, I will generate a configuration file for configuring an L3 VPN service with the VRF name 'Client_A' on the PE routers. 

Hereâ€™s the final configuration file:

```
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.10.10.4:65000
    route-target export 65002:1001
    route-target import 65002:1001
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65000 
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 remote-as 65002
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end 

vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.10.10.6:65000
    route-target export 65004:1002
    route-target import 65004:1002
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/3
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65000 
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.6.2 remote-as 65004
        neighbour 10.0.6.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end 
```

### Explanation:

1. **VRF Definition**:
   - Created a VRF named `Client_A` for both PE routers.
   - Each VRF definition includes a route distinguished (rd) value that consists of the router ID and AS number of the PE router.
   - Route-targets for export and import have been assigned as per convention (using arbitrary values with unique tags).

2. **Interface Configuration**:
   - For each PE router, the interface connected to the CE router is configured with `vrf forwarding Client_A`.

3. **BGP Configuration**:
   - For each PE router, BGP is configured to include the address family for the VRF.
   - The BGP neighbor configuration establishes a relationship with the CE router based on the IP addresses provided in the variables.

This configuration can be pushed to the NSO for provisioning the L3 VPN service. Adjustments could be made to the route-targets as per actual policy and administration requirements.
