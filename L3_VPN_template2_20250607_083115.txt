Based on the provided sample configuration and the user query, here is the generated configuration file for L3 VPN with a VRF name of 'Client_A'. The necessary values from the JSON format have been used to fill in the configuration template.

```plaintext
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.10.10.4:65000  // Assuming AS number is 65000 based on standard practice; modify as needed
    route-target export 65000:100
    route-target import 65000:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65000  // Modify AS number as necessary
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 remote-as 65001  // Assuming CE's AS number is 65001; modify as needed
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end
```

### Explanation:
- **VRF Definition**: The VRF name is set to `Client_A`. The route distinguisher (rd) is provided based on the loopback of the PE router (10.10.10.4) with an assumed AS number (65000) for demonstration purposes. The route target values are placeholders and can be adjusted as needed.
  
- **Interface Configuration**: The configuration for the interface on the PE router uses `GigabitEthernet0/1`, which is connected to the CE router interface.

- **BGP Configuration**: The BGP configuration uses the assumed AS number (65000) for the PE router, and the neighbour IP (`10.0.4.2`) connected to the CE router must have its AS number set (assuming 65001 for the CE router).

Please replace the AS numbers and any other placeholders as per your network design requirements.
