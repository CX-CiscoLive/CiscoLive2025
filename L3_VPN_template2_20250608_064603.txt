Based on the provided user query and sample configuration schema, I will generate the final configuration file for the L3 VPN service with the VRF name as 'Client_A' on PE routers. Here are the variable values extracted from the JSON data:

1. **PE Router Information:**
   - Hostname: PE-1
   - Router ID: 10.10.10.4
   - AS Number: [Assumption needed as it's not provided; let's use AS 65000, or specify accordingly]

2. **CE Router Information:**
   - Hostname: CE-A1
   - IP Address: 10.0.4.1
   - AS Number: [Assumption needed; let's use AS 65001, or specify accordingly]

3. **GirabitEthernet Interface:**
   - PE interface: GigabitEthernet0/1 
   - CE interface: GigabitEthernet0/0 

4. **Route Target:**
   - Export and Import Route Target: [Assumption needed; let's use target:65000:100, or specify accordingly]

Here is the final L3 configuration file:

```plaintext
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.0.4.2:65000
    route-target export target:65000:100
    route-target import target:65000:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A
!
router bgp 65000
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 remote-as 65001
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end
```

### Notes:
- The AS numbers for CE and PE are assumed. Please replace them with actual numbers if available.
- The route target values are also placeholders; replace them with the actual desired values.
- Make sure to adjust any other configurations based on your specific requirements or additional provided data.
