To generate the final configuration for an L3 VPN with the specified details from the provided data, we will extract the necessary values based on the user query and the variables given.

From the data provided, we can gather the following information that needs to be substituted in the configuration template:

### Extracted Values
- **VRF Name**: `Client_A`
- **PE Router**: `PE-1`
- **PE Router AS Number (based on the router's identifier)**: This was not explicitly given in the records. Here we can assume a placeholder (e.g., `65001`).
- **CE Router**: `CE-A1`
- **CE Router AS Number**: Similarly, this is also not explicitly given; a placeholder (e.g., `65002`) will be assumed.
- **Loopback of PE**: This can also be assumed as it is not explicitly given (e.g., `10.10.10.4` as its router ID).
- **Route Target**: A common convention for route targets could be `65001:1` for the PE side for uniqueness.

### Generated Configuration

The generated configuration file using the extracted values would be:

``` 
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.10.10.4:65001
    route-target export 65001:1
    route-target import 65001:1
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65001 
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 remote-as 65002
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end 
```

### Explanation of Configuration Sections
1. **VRF Definition**: Defines the virtual routing and forwarding instance named 'Client_A' with associated route distinguisher and route targets.
2. **Interface Configuration**: The `GigabitEthernet0/1` interface on the PE router is associated with the VRF.
3. **BGP Router Configuration**: Configures BGP for the peer relationship with the CE router.

This configuration is ready to be pushed into the NSO system to facilitate the L3 VPN setup. Adjust the placeholders according to actual network values if necessary.
