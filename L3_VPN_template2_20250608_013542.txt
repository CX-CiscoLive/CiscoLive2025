Based on the user query for configuring an L3 VPN service with a VRF name as 'Client_A' and the provided details from the variables section, here is a generated configuration file to be pushed into NSO:

```
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.0.4.1:65000
    route-target export 65000:100
    route-target import 65000:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A
!
router bgp 65000
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 remote-as 65001
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 activate
    exit-address-family 
end
```

### Explanation of the Configuration:

1. **VRF Definition**: The VRF named 'Client_A' is created with a route-distinguisher formed by the loopback address of the PE router (`10.0.4.1`) and AS number (`65000` for PE). Route-targets for import and export are set both to `65000:100`.

2. **Interface Configuration**: The interface `GigabitEthernet0/1` on the PE router that connects to the CE router (`CE-A1`) is configured to use the 'Client_A' VRF.

3. **BGP Configuration**: BGP is configured for AS `65000`. The address-family for IPv4 under the VRF 'Client_A' is set with a neighbor (`10.0.4.1`, which is the IP address of the CE interface) configured as remote AS `65001`. The neighbor is also activated for BGP.

### Notes:
- Adjust the AS numbers (`65000`, `65001`) to match the configuration of your network if they differ from those used in this example.
- The route-targets can be modified as per your organizational standards or requirements.
