Based on the provided sample configuration and the user query for configuring an L3 VPN with a VRF name of 'Client_A', the configuration file will be generated by mapping the variables from the user input to the schema. The relevant details from the `variables` json indicate the following:

1. **CE Routers**: 
   - CE-A1 (AS Number: 65002, Loopback IP: 10.0.4.1)
   - CE-A3 (AS Number: 65004, Loopback IP: 10.0.6.1)

2. **PE Routers**: 
   - PE-1 (AS Number: 65000, Loopback IP: 10.10.10.4)
   - PE-2 (AS Number: 65000, Loopback IP: 10.10.10.6)

3. **Connecting Interfaces**: 
   - CE-A1 connects to PE-1 via GigabitEthernet0/0 (IP: 10.0.4.1) and GigabitEthernet0/1 (IP: 10.0.4.2)
   - CE-A3 connects to PE-2 via GigabitEthernet0/0 (IP: 10.0.6.1) and GigabitEthernet0/3 (IP: 10.0.6.2)

Let's generate the configuration file with the relevant values.

```plaintext
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.0.4.1:65002
    route-target export 65002:100
    route-target import 65002:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A
!
router bgp 65000
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 remote-as 65002
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 activate
    exit-address-family
end

vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.0.6.1:65004
    route-target export 65004:100
    route-target import 65004:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/3
    vrf forwarding Client_A
!
router bgp 65000
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A
        neighbour 10.0.6.2 remote-as 65004
        neighbour 10.0.6.2 activate
    exit-address-family
end
```

### Notes:
1. **Route Distinguisher**: This is generated from the loopback IP of the CE router and the AS number. The format is `<loopback IP>:<as_number>`.
2. **Route Target**: This is assumed to be the same as the AS number followed by a value (e.g., `100`). Adjust according to your specific requirements.
3. **Interfaces**: Each CE router's interface that connects to its respective PE router is specified.
4. The configuration for each PE is separated, indicating the connection to both CE routers.

Make adjustments as needed depending on your specific routing policies and configurations.
