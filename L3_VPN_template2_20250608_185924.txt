### Explanation of the Configuration:

1. **VRF Definition for Client_A:**
   - The configuration includes the definition of a VRF named `Client_A`. 
   - `rd` (Route Distinguisher) is set to the PE router's loopback address and AS number.
   - `route-targets` for export and import are defined for proper VPN routing.

2. **Interfaces Configuration:**
   - The interfaces connected to the CE routers (`GigabitEthernet0/1` for `PE-1` and `GigabitEthernet0/3` for `PE-2`) are configured to use the VRF `Client_A`.

3. **BGP Configuration:**
   - Each BGP configuration for the PE routers includes an `address-family ipv4 vrf` directive for the VRF `Client_A`, specifying the CE routers as neighbors and their corresponding AS numbers.

Please modify the route-targets and any other parameters based on your specific routing requirements or network policies if needed.
