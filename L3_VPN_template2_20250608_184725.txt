Based on the provided `user_query` and the associated `variables`, we can generate the L3 VPN configuration for the two CE-PE pairs as described in the query.

### Configuration Generation:

We'll extract the necessary details from the records to customize the configuration:

1. For **CE-A1**:
   - CE AS Number: 65002
   - PE Router: PE-1
   - PE AS Number: 65000
   - VRF Name: Client_A
   - Route Target: (Assumed as "100:1" for construction)
   - Loopback of PE: (Assumed as "10.10.10.4" based on PE router’s router ID)

2. For **CE-A3**:
   - CE AS Number: 65004
   - PE Router: PE-2
   - PE AS Number: 65000
   - VRF Name: Client_A
   - Route Target: (Assumed as "100:2" for construction)
   - Loopback of PE: (Assumed as "10.10.10.6" based on PE router’s router ID)

Now, we substitute the placeholder variables in the sample configuration with the extracted values.

### Final Configuration File:

```
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.10.10.4:65000
    route-target export 100:1
    route-target import 100:1
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65000
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 remote-as 65002
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end 

vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.10.10.6:65000
    route-target export 100:2
    route-target import 100:2
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/3
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65000
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.6.2 remote-as 65004
        neighbour 10.0.6.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end 
```

### Notes:
- The Route Target values (100:1 and 100:2) were assumed for this configuration as they weren't provided and could vary based on the network design.
- The loopback of PE and other settings are based on the router IDs provided for construction; these should be adapted if the actual values differ.
- This configuration assumes a standard approach to VRF and BGP configurations for L3 VPN services. Adjustments may be necessary based on specific organizational policies or configurations.
