Sure! Below is the generated configuration file for the NSO L3 VPN setup based on the provided user query and variable values. Each device's configuration is separated by the `<per-device-config>` tag for easy parsing. 

```xml

### Explanation of Configuration Elements:
- **vrf definition**: Each PE router has a VRF named `Client_A`. The route distinguisher (RD) is formed by combining the router's loopback address and its AS number (e.g., `10.10.10.4:65000` for PE-1).
- **route-target**: Specifies the import and export route targets. In this example, hypothetical values are used (`65000:100` for PE-1 and `65000:200` for PE-2).
- **interface configuration**: Each PE interface that connects to the CE router is associated with the `Client_A` VRF.
- **router bgp configuration**: BGP is configured for the VRF and specifies the neighbor information (IP and remote AS).

This format can be easily parsed for individual device configurations and is structured properly for NSO deployment.
