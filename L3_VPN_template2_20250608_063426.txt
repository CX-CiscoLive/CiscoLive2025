Based on the provided sample configuration schema and the variable values from your query, I will generate a final configuration file for the Layer 3 VPN service with VRF name as 'Client_A'.

Here's the generated configuration:

```
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.0.4.1:65001
    route-target export 65001:100
    route-target import 65001:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65001
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 remote-as 65002
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end
```

### Explanation of the Configuration:
1. **VRF Definition**: The VRF is named `Client_A`. The route-distinguisher (rd) is formulated using `10.0.4.1` (the loopback of PE) and `65001` (the AS number of PE). Route-targets are set to export and import values.
2. **Address Family**: The address-family for IPv4 configuration is specified and closed appropriately.
3. **Interface Configuration**: The interface `GigabitEthernet0/1` connects to the CE and is set to use the VRF `Client_A`.
4. **BGP Configuration**: The router BGP process for AS `65001` is defined. It includes a BGP neighbor `10.0.4.2` (the address of the CE interface) with its respective remote AS `65002`.

Please ensure you adjust the AS numbers and RT values as per your network policy or architecture if needed.
