Based on the provided sample configuration and the details from the user query, we can generate the final configuration file for the L3 VPN with the specified parameters. 

From the data provided, we can extract the necessary variables for substituting into the sample configuration:

- VRF Name: `Client_A`
- Loopback of PE: `10.10.10.4` (Router ID of PE-1)
- AS Number of PE: This is not explicitly provided, so we will assume a hypothetical value (e.g., `65000`).
- Route Target: Given the context, we can assume a route target, for instance, `65000:100` for the export/import. You might want to adjust this value as per your exact requirements.
- Interface of PE: Interface found for PE-1 is `GigabitEthernet0/1`.
- Neighbour IP of CE Interface: The given IP of the CE interface (linked to PE) is `10.0.4.1`.
- AS Number of CE: This might also need a hypothetical value (e.g., `65001`).

Hereâ€™s how the final configuration would look:

```
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.10.10.4:65000
    route-target export 65000:100
    route-target import 65000:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65000
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 remote-as 65001
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end
```

This configuration file can be used to push the L3 VPN setup for the VRF named 'Client_A' on the specified PE router. Adjust any hypothetical values as necessary to reflect your actual network configuration.
