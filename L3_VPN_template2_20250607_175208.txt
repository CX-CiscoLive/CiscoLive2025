Based on the information provided in the user query and configuration schema, we need to generate a configuration file for L3 VPN using the specified VRF name 'Client_A'. The details extracted from the variables will be utilized as part of the configuration settings.

Here's the final configuration file generated for NSO:

```
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.0.4.1:65001
    route-target export 65001:100
    route-target import 65001:100
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65001
    address-family ipv4 vrf  Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 remote-as 65002
        neighbour 10.0.4.2 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end
```

### Explanation of the Configuration:
- **VRF Definition**: Defined a VRF named 'Client_A' with a Route Distinguisher (RD) composed of the IP address of the PE router (`10.0.4.1`) and an ASN (`65001`). The Route Targets (export/import) are set to `65001:100`.
- **Interface Configuration**: The interface `GigabitEthernet0/1` on the PE router is configured to use the relevant VRF.
- **BGP Configuration**: Within the router BGP configuration for ASN `65001`, it specifies a neighbor relationship with the CE interface IP (`10.0.4.2`) belonging to the CE router, which uses ASN `65002`, and activates this neighbor under the specified address-family.

Adjust the ASN and Route Targets based on actual network configuration requirements as necessary. If other specific values are provided for `as_number`, `route_target`, or other parameters, those should replace the placeholder values accordingly.
