Based on the provided user query and variable values, here is the generated configuration file for the L3 VPN service on the PE routers:

```plaintext
! Configuration for PE-1
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.10.10.4:65000
    route-target export 65000:100
    route-target import 65000:100
!

exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!

    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 remote-as 65002
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end 

! Configuration for PE-2
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.10.10.6:65000
    route-target export 65000:200
    route-target import 65000:200
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/3
    vrf forwarding Client_A 
!
router bgp 65000 
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A 
        neighbour 10.0.6.1 remote-as 65004
        neighbour 10.0.6.1 activate  
    exit-address-family 
end 
```

### Explanation:
- The **VRF Name** is set to `Client_A` as per the request.
- The **Route Distinguisher** (RD) is configured using the router ID of the PE followed by its AS number.
- **Route Targets** are assigned as `65000:100` and `65000:200`. These values can be customized based on specific deployment needs.
- Interfaces connected to respective CE routers (GigabitEthernet0/1 for PE-1 and GigabitEthernet0/3 for PE-2) are set to use the vrf forwarding configuration.
- BGP neighbor configurations are based on the IP addresses of the connected CE routers, along with their respective AS numbers. 

This configuration is now ready to be pushed into NSO for implementation.
