Based on the provided sample configuration schema and the details from the user query, I will generate a configuration file for the L3 VPN service with the specified VRF name "Client_A". 

From the variable values JSON, we can extract necessary details for the configuration:

- **PE Router Details**:
  - Hostname: PE-1
  - Router ID: 10.10.10.4
  - AS Number (derived from router_id): Assuming the AS Number based on common practices (e.g., 65001).

- **CE Router Details**:
  - Hostname: CE-A1
  - CE Interface IP: 10.0.4.1
  - Connected PE Interface IP: 10.0.4.2
  - CE AS Number: Assuming this to be 65002.

Now, I will fill in the values in the provided configuration template:

```plaintext
vrf definition Client_A
    rd 10.0.4.1:65001
    route-target export 65001:1
    route-target import 65001:1
!
address-family ipv4
exit-address-family

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    vrf forwarding Client_A
!
router bgp 65001
    address-family ipv4 vrf Client_A
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 remote-as 65002
        neighbour 10.0.4.1 activate
    exit-address-family
end
```

### Explanation:
- **VRF Definition**: 
  - The VRF name is set to "Client_A".
  - Route Distinguisher (RD) combines the CE router IP and PE router's assumed AS number.
  - Route targets are set as an example with a typical format, using 1 as the value to distinguish.

- **Interface Configuration**: 
  - The interface name is specified as `GigabitEthernet0/1`, which connects to CE-A1 based on the provided records.

- **BGP Configuration**:
  - The BGP process is configured for the assumed AS number 65001 with the IPv4 address family specific for the "Client_A" VRF.
  - The neighbor IP is set to the CE interface IP address with the respective remote AS number.

This configuration can be used to push into the NSO system.
